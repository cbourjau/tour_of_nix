Welcome to 'A tour of Nix', a beautifully crafted introduction into the 
[Nix programming language](http://nixos.org/nix/manual/).


**'A tour of Nix' focuses on programming language constructs and how 
Nix can be algorithmically 
used to solve problems.** However, this is not an introduction into `nix-env`, 
`nix-shell`, `nix-repl` and 
we won't build/install software using `stdenv.mkDerivation`. Still 
we bundled [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) into 
'A tour of Nix' and you can use the **Nix library** functions' from 
**pkgs/lib**, which are used for packaging software.

When ready, just click the next button on the top right corner.

**Note:** 'A tour of Nix' can be used offline once it has loaded in the 
browser.

### emscripten (1.29.10)
-----
Emscripten is available under 2 licenses, the MIT license and the
University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License.

Both are permissive open source licenses, with little if any
practical difference between them.

The reason for offering both is that (1) the MIT license is
well-known, while (2) the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source
License allows Emscripten's code to be integrated upstream into
LLVM, which uses that license, should the opportunity arise.
